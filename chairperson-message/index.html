            <h1 class="display-6 ft-Marcel "> Chairperson's Message</h1>
            <p class="mt-4">Thirty years ago, I started Indiaâ€™s first animal rescue centre and hospital. instrumental in eradicating rabies from Delhi.

                I could not have done this alone. It was achieved only because people like you contributed to its upkeep. Today SGACC has over 3000 animals in the shelter. We have abandoned animals, accident, and illness cases. We have hundreds of cows and buffaloes who come in every week when they are saved from illegal slaughter by police teams working with People For Animals. We have people bringing in their pets for treatment at nominal cost, or to abandon on the pretext they have found them on the street. We have people who call us at three in the morning because they want to remove a barking dog. We work round the clock.
                
                We get no grants from the government or from foreign foundations and are completely dependent on donations. Our services even for the paying customers are the cheapest in India. We have a x-ray and blood lab for animals in Delhi.
                
                But the hospital is simply collapsing under the weight of the load it is attempting to carry. Every year, the rains damage part of our infrastructure. In winter we are hard pressed to arrange covered shelter for all of the daily arrivals. In summer we have to arrange additional fans and coolers. We simply do not have the ability to carry on like this. We have pending repairs, need to employ more doctors, and improve the infrastructure to make it more animal friendly. We need your help.
